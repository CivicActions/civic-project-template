# [Project Name] Overview

## Description

This is a stub repository to begin to outline minimum project documentation artifacts. The README.md file should provide all participants with core information about where project design / development / documention / code artifacts reside, and should be updated to ensure it contains all the information a new developer, project manager or project owner should need to take control of, and continue development of the project.

### Objectives

To create a core set of documentation artifacts that should be present in EVERY CivicActions project that has code associated with it.
