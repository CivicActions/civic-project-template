#About these governance templates

The purpose of these artifacts is to create a concise map of governance issues for public projects to enable team members to identify gaps in understanding about key governance issues.

The content for these templates could initially come from RFP responses or contract SOWs, but in most cases, are based on preconditions required by contract SOWs. In the latter case, it is important that these conditions be documented and clear to all stakeholders in the project to ensure smooth project orientation and working communications.

These artifacts are meant to be published to the PUBLIC, therefore, the scope of question responses should be limited to project/product information that can be made available to the general public. 

The areas covered by these artifacts are consonant with ISO/IEC 38500:2024.
